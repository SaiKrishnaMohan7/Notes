# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Data Structures

### Stacks

- Main operations and and their time compelxities:

  - push: add an item to the top of the stack (TOS); *O(1)* since one side
  - pop: remove an item from TOS; *O(1)* since one side
  - peek: read itme at TOS; *O(1)* since one side
  - length/size: no. of elements in the stack
  - search: _search_ - *O(n)*

- Applications:

  - Paranthesis balancing, palindrome, back button of the browser, undo and redo operations

### Sets

  All elments are unique, Order is maintained

- Main operations and their time compelxities:

  - has: a set has a value or not; *O(n)* need verif
  - add: add an item; *O(1)*
  - remove/delete: remove item; *O(1)*
  - length/size: no. of elements in the set; *O(1)*
  - union: merge two sets; *O(n * k)*
  - intersection: common elements between two sets: *O(n * k)*
  - difference: difference between two sets: *O(n * k)*
  - subset: wether given set is a subset of the given set: *O(n * k)*

- Applications:

  - Paranthesis balancing, palindrome, back button of the browser, undo and redo operations
