## Clickjacking

- UI based attack, user doesn't see the actual button/link they are clikcing on. Can be a full website hidden from the user embedded inside an iframe

- Differs from a CSRF attack, request not forged without user knowledge

- Use CSS to obscure something and let user click the button
